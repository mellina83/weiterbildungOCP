	 * 12.4. Initialization of Classes and Interfaces

	Initialization of a class consists of executing its static initializers and the initializers for 
	static fields (class variables) declared in the class.

	Initialization of an interface consists of executing the initializers for fields (constants) declared in the interface.

	Before a class is initialized, its direct superclass must be initialized, but interfaces implemented by the class are 
	not initialized. Similarly, the superinterfaces of an interface are not initialized before the interface is initialized. 


	 * 12.4.1. When Initialization Occurs

	A class or interface type T will be initialized immediately before the first occurrence of any one of the following:

	    T is a class and an instance of T is created.

	    T is a class and a static method declared by T is invoked.

	    A static field declared by T is assigned.

	    A static field declared by T is used and the field is not a constant variable (§4.12.4).

	    T is a top level class (§7.6), and an assert statement (§14.10) lexically nested within T (§8.1.3) is executed.

	A reference to a static field (§8.3.1.1) causes initialization of only the class or interface that actually declares it, 
	even though it might be referred to through the name of a subclass, a subinterface, or a class that implements an interface.

	Invocation of certain reflective methods in class Class and in package java.lang.reflect also causes class or interface initialization.

	A class or interface will not be initialized under any other circumstance.

	The intent is that a class or interface type has a set of initializers that put it in a consistent state, and that this 
	state is the first state that is observed by other classes. The static initializers and class variable initializers are 
	executed in textual order, and may not refer to class variables declared in the class whose declarations appear textually 
	after the use, even though these class variables are in scope (§8.3.2.3). This restriction is designed to detect, at 
	compile time, most circular or otherwise malformed initializations.

	The fact that initialization code is unrestricted allows examples to be constructed (§8.3.2.3) where the value of a 
	class variable can be observed when it still has its initial default value, before its initializing expression is 
	evaluated, but such examples are rare in practice. 
	(Such examples can be also constructed for instance variable initialization (§12.5).) 
	The full power of the Java programming language is available in these initializers; 
	programmers must exercise some care. This power places an extra burden on code generators, 
	but this burden would arise in any case because the Java programming language is concurrent (§12.4.2).
