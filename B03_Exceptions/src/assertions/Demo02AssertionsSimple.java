package assertions;
/**
 * The simple version adds a second expression, separated from the first
 * (boolean expression) by a colon, this expression's string value is added to
 * the stack trace.
 * 
 * Both versions throw an immediate AssertionError, but the simple version gives
 * you a little more debugging help while the really simple version simply tells
 * you only that your assumption was false.
 * 
 * Assertions are typically enabled when an application is being tested and
 * debugged, but disabled when the application is deployed. The assertions are
 * still in the code, although ignored by the JVM, so if you do have a deployed
 * application that starts misbehaving, you can always choose to enable
 * assertions in the field for additional testing.
