/**
 * Don't Use Assert Expressions that Can Cause Side Effects!
 * 
 * The rule is, an assert expression should leave the program in the same state
 * it was in before the expression!
 * 
 * Think about it. assert expressions aren't guaranteed to always run, so you
 * don't want your code to behave differently depending on whether assertions
 * are enabled.
 * 
 * Assertions must not cause any side effects.
 * 
 * If assertions are enabled, the only change to the way your program runs is
 * that an AssertionError can be thrown if one of your assertions (think:
 * assumptions) turns out to be false.
