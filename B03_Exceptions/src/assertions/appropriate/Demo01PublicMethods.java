 * 
 * Don't Use Assertions to Validate Arguments to a Public Method
 * 
 * A public method might be called from code that you don't control (or from
 * code you have never seen).
 * 
 * If you need to validate public method arguments, you'll probably use
 * exceptions to throw, say, an IllegalArgumentException if the values passed to
 * the public method are invalid.
